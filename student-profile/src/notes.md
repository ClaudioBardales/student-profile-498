# Functional Requirements

I would have to fetch all of the data from the api that was provided to me. -> DONE

- I will use axios for this part because i have done it before with GIPHY API, so it should be the same. -> DONE

Make the List of the student profiles scrollable so that the user can scroll up and down. ->DONE

- This part should be easy because it's pretty much using overflow...? if not i will research on this. -> DONE

Then create a search bar that filters the search result of the student that the user wants to look up. -> WORK IN PROGRESS

Then try to go toggle the profile for more information. -> WORK IN PROGRESS, MIGHT WORK ON THIS NEXT.

Also wanted an input to add a tag to the profile.

Then make a search bar so the user can search by tag.

## Notes to Remind myself.

- I have to make seperate components for everything to add the searchbar.

- Google Hide/Close for react..? hmmm

- Must find an algo in order for me to filter out the items and then add tag component as well to each item.

- After Filter the tags by adding a second search bar.

- Then clean up code as much as you can, make it smaller and easier to understand for the next dev to see it.

- THREE MORE FEATURES TO GO!
