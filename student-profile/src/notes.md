# Functional Requirements

I would have to fetch all of the data from the api that was provided to me.

- I will use axios for this part because i have done it before with GIPHY API, so it should be the same.

Make the List of the student profiles scrollable so that the user can scroll up and down.

- This part should be easy because it's pretty much using overflow...? if not i will research on this.

Then create a search bar that filters the search result of the student that the user wants to look up.

- Use filter option..?

Then try to go toggle the profile for more information.

Also wanted an input to add a tag to the profile.

Then make a search bar so the user can search by tag.
